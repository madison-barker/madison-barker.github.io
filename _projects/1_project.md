Language production allows for internal ideas and concepts to be represented as an external comprehensible message. For example, if a speaker views a scene of a man proposing, they may describe this event in the following ways: The man is proposing to the woman, the woman is being proposed to, the man is kneeling before the woman, the woman is standing in front of the man, and so on.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/13.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    How would you describe this scene?

How do speakers decide what to say and when? Unlike what goes on in our head, we are not able to say more than one word at a time. Instead, we must prioritize certain elements if our message, ultimately choosing where to begin, as well as what to include. This requirement to order our throughts has been referred to as the linearization problem. 

Given the near infinite number of ways thoughts and ideas can be expressed linguistically, how do speakers decide what to say and in what order?  

In this study, subjects described simple networks with interconnected colored dots while their eye movements were recorded. Our goal was to (1) investigate the incrementality of discourse level planning and production and to (2) revisit the minimal-load principle and examine which network properties drive linearization using data from both speech and eye movements.
