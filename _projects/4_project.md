As with the inequity that exists within the adult production work, there is also more research in children’s language comprehension than production, and even less on multi-utterance production. The ability to linearize information into an orderly and comprehensible way for the listener, as well as the speaker, is a skill that is refined and improved over time. Despite the robust changes that children undergo in their ability to generate a linearization plan, there lacks a theoretical understanding of these changes. 

The aim of this project is to better understand the relationship between the linguistic and the visual systems and how features in one’s environment are used to order information across multiple utterances. Investigating a population that encompasses a developmentally interesting time point,
we can explore the role of other cognitive systems, and the development of such, on language production and the generation of linearization strategies. This work will provide a starting point for investigating the way children address the linearization problem, and identify the components that play a role in structuring such linearization plan. The experiment presented in this chapter provides a preliminary evaluation of children’s linguistic abilities, namely the ability to order information across a discourse in typically developing children.

Example of survey users were provided and asked to provide a label for each of the objects they saw in the scene.

So how did the children do compared to the adults? For one, children said a lot less. They also provided less rich descriptions, but made less errors (disfluencies).

Given the limited sample size, few conclusions can be drawn from the **preliminary results**. However, there are several **qualitative differences** that are linguistically interesting. First, for children, we observed a long onset latency. Compared to adults who consistently spend 1-2 s preparing to speak, regardless of the production task (e.g., Griffin & Bock, 2000; Barker et al., 2023), children spend about twice as long preparing their description. 

Moreover, there were differences in the way in which children and adults began their descriptions. Whereas disfluencies were a common, and perhaps strategic, start to scene descriptions in adults, essentially none of the children started their descriptions with an ”uh” or ”um”. One possibility for these differences could be pragmatic: Adults have extensive experience conversing with others and recognize that long, unfilled pauses are somewhat unacceptable for normal discourse.

As such, they produce a filled pause at the onset of their description as a way to further extend their preparation time while avoiding a long silence. Children, on the other hand, may not be motivated by these types of social factors, or perhaps they are used to being “given the floor”.Other **qualitative differences** that are worthy of empirical investigation surround differences in linguistic diversity. 

Not only do children provide more parsimonious descriptions in length (time) and word count, they also tend to use much simpler and recycled constructions. Adults often make use of prepositional phrases when describing scenes; children mostly tended to provide list- like descriptions. The lack of relational information used for describing scenes may suggest that children are less likely to cluster their responses based on spatial and/or semantic information (Tachihara et al., Under Review). Specifically, the use of prepositional phrases allows for chunks of the scene to be planned and described, such as using an anchor object as the location for the satellite objects within a cluster (Ferreira & Barker, 2024).
