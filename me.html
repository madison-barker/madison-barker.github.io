    <h1>Hi there, my name is Madison. It's great to meet you!</h1>

    <section>
        <p>I am a fifth-year graduate student in Psychology at the University of California, Davis. I study language production, namely multi-utterance production, under the advisement of Dr. Fernanda Ferreira. My research is focused on better understanding the linearization problem (how do people decide what to say and when?). We use real-world scenes to get participants to elicit such descriptions, implement eyetracking to monitor their eye movements, and a number of computational methods to quantify scene features, to begin to address this question.</p>
        
        <p>Before UC Davis, I received my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Journalism from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During my time at UW Madison, I worked as a research assistant under the advisement of Dr. Mark Seidenberg. With his mentorship, as well as the fantastic guidance of (then) graduate student, Dr. Matt Cooper Borkenhagen (now at Florida State University), I completed an honor's senior thesis, <em> Computing Sublexical Semantics in Written Mandarin</em>. 
        This project earned the <em> Psychology Undergraduate Research Scholar Award</em> and was later published in <a href="./data/wangetal2022.pdf"><em>Reading and Writing</em></a>. </p>
