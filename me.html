        <p>I am a fifth-year graduate student in Psychology at the University of California, Davis. I study language production, namely multi-utterance production, under the advisement of Dr. Fernanda Ferreira. My research is focused on better understanding the linearization problem (how do people decide what to say and when?). We use real-world scenes to get participants to elicit such descriptions, implement eyetracking to monitor their eye movements, and a number of computational methods to quantify scene features, to begin to address this question. </p>
