# Cycling 
I spend a lot of my free time in the saddle. For 22 years, my father, a prolific biker, tried to convert me from a runner to a cyclist. After breaking my hip, both shins, a foot, a toe, and partially tearing my quad, I transitioned my Nikes to Shimanos.

Recently, I've started integrating gravel rides into my routine as I prepare for a 200km ride in [Iceland, July 2024](https://www.therift.bike/).
