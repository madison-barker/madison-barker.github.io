**Hi again! My name is Madison, and I love working with data!**

I began my academic journey at Columbia University as a Division I sprinter before transferring to the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison to pursue a degree in journalism from the [School of Journalism and Mass Communication](https://journalism.wisc.edu/). There, I followed the **strategic communications track**, gaining a strong foundation in persuasive and action-oriented messaging.



Soon after my acceptance into the program, I joined the Language and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, where I trained as an undergraduate researcher under  [Dr. Mark Seidenberg](https://psych.wisc.edu/staff/seidenberg-mark-s/) and (then-graduate student) [Dr. Matt Cooper Borkenhagen](https://annescollege.fsu.edu/faculty-staff/dr-matt-cooper-borkenhagen). I completed an honors senior thesis, *Computing Sublexical Semantics in Written Mandarin*, which earned the Outstanding Undergraduate Research Scholar Award, and was later published in [Reading & Writing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11145-022-10260-y).

I then went on to complete my PhD at **UC Davis** under the advisement of [Dr. Fernanda Ferreira](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/fernanda-ferreira). My research was interdisciplinary and methodologically diverse, incorporating eyetracking, survey design, A/B testing, clustering, mixed-effects modeling, and NLP tools to investigate how people plan and produce complex discourse. To learn more about these specific projects, you can visit the [Projects](/projects/) tab above.
