Hi there, my name is Madison Barker. It's great to meet you!

<br/>
I am a recent graduate in the [Department of Psychology at the University of California, Davis](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/) where I received my PhD. My research centered on language production, namely multi-utterance production, and I completed my training under the advisement of [Dr. Fernanda Ferreira](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/fernanda-ferreira). 

As a graduate student, I worked on projects that involved a number of behavioral and computational methods. To learn more about these specific projects, you can visit my [projects](/projects) or check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z3Gy3LsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

You can check out the [about](/about_me/) tab to read more about my educational background and what got me interested and involved in research! 

Lastly, I love integrating my hobbies with my work, which you can also check out on my [here](/projects/#fun).
