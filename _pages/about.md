Hi there, my name is Madison. It's great to meet you!

I am a recent graduate in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Davis where I received my PhD. I research centered on language production, namely multi-utterance production, and I completed my training under the advisement of [Dr. Fernanda Ferreira](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/fernanda-ferreira). Check out the [About](/al-folio/pages/about_full) tab to read more about my educational background! 

My dissertation investigated multi-utterance language production in adults and children. I approached these questions using a number of behavioral and computational methods. Check out the [About](/al-folio/pages/about_full) tab to read more about my educational background, and my [projects](/al-folio/pages/projects] tab to read more about the specific projects I have worked on. 

Lastly, I love integrating my hobbies with my work, which you can also check out on my [projects](/al-folio/pages/projects) page.
